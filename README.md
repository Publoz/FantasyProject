# FantasyProject
My first project making a Wellington handball fantasy league website


![Preview](https://github.com/Publoz/FantasyProject/blob/main/preview.JPG)

## What I learnt
- How the server-client architecure works
- Using SQL to store data in the backend
- Python Flask as a good starting approach to manage the backend
- Using JS and the DOM to change the webpage
- How the backend and frontend can access data from each other

## Todo
- Incorporate Bootstrap to make the website responsive
- Tidy up security elements
- Adding a few more features for Admins and users
- Deploy!
